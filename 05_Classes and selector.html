            Classes and selectors
        </title>
        <body>
            <p>
                Classes are use to select any specific point where tag is used. From everytime the tag is used.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example - in this page there are 3 p tags and i just need to modify 3rd p tag so for that i will make a class in it.
            </p>
            <p class="error">
                Here i made a class with name error.
            </p>

            <div>
                We can also use same class everytime we need same formatting.
            </div>
            <div class="error">
                Like here i am going to use error class again. 
                Now you will see that both (above used p tag and this div tag) will get same formatting.
            </div>
            <h4 class="error">
                If we use tag name with class name than in this case only that class will get modified which uses that tag.
                Like in this case only this tag will get modified.
            </h4>

            <div class="error feedback">
                We can also give multiple classes to a tag.
            </div> 
            <div id="content">
                We can also use id in css.
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>
                    In this case i am going to use decendent selectors.
                    In decendent selectors, we use parent (in this case "div") and children (in this case "p") tag together to modify content.
                </p>
