        <h2>HTML, CSS, JavaScript : all of these are client side language. It means it rolls on your computer in your browser.<br>
         when you type it in your browser, it communicates with server, which brings information to your browser, which displays in the form of webpage.<br>
        All other programmming languages are server side language.  </h2>


        <div>Cascade : Cascade means water that flows down the side of a mountain. 
            or in general anything that flows from top to bottom.
            CSS also follow top to bottom (i:e parent to child) approach.
            i:e if we do styling in parent tag, its child tag will automatically get modified.
            but in vice versa, be need to mention parent and child tag to modify that specific chil tag.<br>
        </div>

        <div>JavaScript :JavaScript is scripting language.<br>
            it is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:<br>

            1. HTML to define the content of web pages.<br>
         
            2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages.<br>
         
            3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages<br>

            just like CSS, we add JavaScript to html by linking it.<br>

            syntax - <br>
            <script src="javascript_file.js"></script> <br>
            syntax is taking script tag hence not showing on web page, please check its html file. <br>
            this will link this js file to current project. and just like css we have normally do js programnming in that js file, which will be apllied here.
        </div>
        <br><br>
        
        <div>Inline elements: These are those elements, that don't take any more room than there content needs.<br>
            If placed one after another, they will show side by side on the web page.<br>
            Example: span, img, strong, em, a, etc......<br>
            To devide them we use various tags like br.<br>
            in Inline elements padding will be added all around but margin will be just added to left and right, not top and bottom.<br>
        </div>
        <br><br>

        <div>
            Block level elements : these elements take whole width of the page. regardless of content.<br>
            Hence when added, content after that will automatically come below them.<br>
            Example : p, div, h1, h2, h3, ul, ol, li, etc..... <br>
            In block level elements marging (outside) and padding (inside) are all around element.<br>
        </div>
        <br><br>

        <div>User agent stylesheet : It is default syl set by browser. it occurs when no style is given to the element.</div>

        <div>
            Position : types - Static, Relative, Fixed, Absolute, Sticky
            in Absolute we take the content out of the webpage. i:e it gets fix at a spot above the webpage.
        </div>
        <br><br>

        <div>
            Media queries : it tell the browser how to style an element at a particular viewpoint dimension.
            Viewport meta tag : It tells the browser what width the viewpoint should be.
            Responsive images : only load smaller images for mobile devices.
        </div>
        <br><br>

        <div>
            CSS Animation : It helps in making animated web elements.
            It eliminates the need of JS/JQuery for animation effect.
            
        </div>
