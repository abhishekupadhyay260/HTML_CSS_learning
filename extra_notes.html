        <div>Inline elements: These are those elements, that don't take any more room than there content needs.<br>
            If placed one after another, they will show side by side on the web page.<br>
            Example: span, img, strong, em, a, etc......<br>
            To devide them we use various tags like br.<br>
            in Inline elements padding will be added all around but margin will be just added to left and right, not top and bottom.<br>
        </div>
        <br><br>

        <div>
            Block level elements : these elements take whole width of the page. regardless of content.<br>
            Hence when added, content after that will automatically come below them.<br>
            Example : p, div, h1, h2, h3, ul, ol, li, etc..... <br>
            In block level elements marging (outside) and padding (inside) are all around element.<br>
        </div>
